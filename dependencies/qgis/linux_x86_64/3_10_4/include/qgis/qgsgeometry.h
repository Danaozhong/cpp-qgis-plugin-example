/**
 * \ingroup core
 * A geometry is the spatial representation of a feature.
 *
 * QgsGeometry acts as a generic container for geometry objects. QgsGeometry objects are implicitly shared,
 * so making copies of geometries is inexpensive. The geometry container class can also be stored inside
 * a QVariant object.
 *
 * The actual geometry representation is stored as a QgsAbstractGeometry within the container, and
 * can be accessed via the get() method or set using the set() method. This gives access to the underlying
 * raw geometry primitive, such as the point, line, polygon, curve or other geometry subclasses.
 *
 * \note QgsGeometry objects are inherently Cartesian/planar geometries. They have no concept of geodesy, and none
 * of the methods or properties exposed from the QgsGeometry API (or QgsAbstractGeometry subclasses) utilize
 * geodesic calculations. Accordingly, properties like length() and area() or spatial operations like buffer()
 * are always calculated using strictly Cartesian mathematics. In contrast, the QgsDistanceArea class exposes
 * methods for working with geodesic calculations and spatial operations on geometries,
 * and should be used whenever calculations which account for the curvature of the Earth (or any other celestial body)
 * are required.
